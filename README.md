## Word Cloud in Different Segments

### Word Clouds For Fiction Writers

Every writer has words they like to use over and over. When we edit our own words, it's hard to see what our overused words are. But when we use them too often, our writing sounds redundant. A word cloud can help you identify your overused words. The most commonly used words are the biggest. It's easy to see if the big words are the words you want to use the most.
A word cloud can also make sure you are focusing on the right characters, themes, and plot points. If your book is about Jane, but Jack's name is three times bigger, you might need to re-evaluate your manuscript. If your book is about a war, but the words "war" and "battle" are tiny on your word cloud, you'll need to develop that plot more. 

### Word Clouds For Copywriters And Bloggers
Search engine optimization. It can be the bane of copywriters and bloggers everywhere. The algorithms are always changing. But it doesn't have to be a mystery. The most important part of SEO is keywords.

Run your copy or blog post through a word cloud generator. Are your target keywords huge or tiny? What words have you inadvertently turned into SEO keywords? This will help you figure out exactly what edits you need to make to reach those high search engine rankings.

## When to use Word Cloud

For fiction, you can use word clouds of different scenes to compare how your characters feel about the inciting action. A word cloud will help you notice right away if your characters’ reactions are similar in both scenes. You’ll be able to identify where you should have a new reaction or a new emotion.

For business purposes, word clouds can help you find your customers’ pain points. If you collect feedback from your customers, you can generate a word cloud using customers’ language to help identify what is most important to them. Imagine if “long wait time” cropped up as major emphasis words in customer feedback. That should ring a warning bell.

If you are in the business-to-consumer writing industry, a word cloud will highlight overuse of technical jargon. You can make sure your language is accessible to consumers with a quick, visual model.
